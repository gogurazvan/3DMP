# 2 Speed Gearbox

This mechanism alters the input speed from the power source using gear ratios.
I chose it due it's simplicity and practicality in real life(the most well known use being for automobiles)

## How it works

```
The mechanism is powered by the lever spining the first axle that moves freely from it's cogs using the bearings. The ring on the axle spins with it and moving it determines the state of the machine.
In neutral state the ring doesn't interact with any cog so no movement is transmited to the rotor. 
In first gear the ring goes near the small cog and moves it, the small gear will spin a bigger gear that is connected to the 2nd axle that moves the rotor. Due to gear ratio the second axle with the big gear will have less rotational speed than the first.
In second gear the ring goes near the big cog and moves it, the big gear will spin a smaller gear that is connected to the 2nd axle that moves the rotor. Due to gear ratio the second axle with the small gear will have more rotational speed than the first.
